# The allow directive is used to designate a particular subnet from which NTP clients
# are allowed to access the computer as an NTP server. The default is that no clients
# are allowed access, i.e. chronyd operates purely as an NTP client. If the allow
# directive is used, chronyd will be both a client of its servers, and a server to other clients.
